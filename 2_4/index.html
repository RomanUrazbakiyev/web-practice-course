        <h2>---About me---</h2>
        <p>
            Hey there! I'm Stitch, the little blue alien with a big heart. So, let me tell you about my favorite
            hobbies and what I enjoy doing in my free time.
        </p>
        <p>
            First and foremost, <span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXpB1rixnPQ">I absolutely love
                    surfing</a></span>! There's nothing quite like catching a gnarly
            wave and
            feeling the rush as I ride it to the shore. The waves here in Hawaii, where I live with Lilo, are simply
            awesome, and I never miss a chance to hit the water. Surfing gives me a sense of freedom and joy like
            nothing else.
        </p>
        <p>
            When I'm not surfing, you can often find me experimenting with my gadgets. I'm a bit of a tech geek, and
            I love tinkering with all sorts of devices. I have a natural talent for fixing and creating things, and
            it's incredibly satisfying to see my inventions come to life. Plus, it's fun to see Lilo's face light up
            when she sees my latest creations!
        </p>
        <div class="rocket">
            <img src="./img/rocket.jpg" alt="Rocket" width="290px" height="200px">
        </div>
        <p>
            Speaking of Lilo, spending time with her is one of my favorite pastimes. She's my best friend and
            'ohana, which means family. We do everything together, from dancing the hula to exploring the beautiful
            Hawaiian islands. Our bond is unique, and I cherish every moment we share.
        <div class="hugs">

        </div>
        </p>
        <p>
            Another thing I enjoy is trying out new foods. I have a pretty adventurous palate, and I'm always up for
            tasting exotic and unusual dishes. Hawaii offers a wide variety of delicious treats from different
            cultures, and I'm eager to try them all! Experimenting with cooking is also a hobby of mine, although it
            sometimes ends up with a messy kitchen!
        </p>
        <p>
            Oh, and how can I forget about my love for playing the ukulele? Music has a way of soothing my soul, and
            the ukulele's sweet melodies resonate with me. I'm no professional musician, but I play from the heart,
            and that's all that matters.
        </p>
        <div class="dancing">
            <img src="./img/dancing.jpg" alt="Dancing" width="290px" height="200px">
        </div>
        <p>
            Last but not least, I enjoy capturing memories through photography. Hawaii's stunning landscapes and
            vibrant colors make the perfect backdrop for my snapshots. I love to look back at these photos, reliving
            the happy moments and feeling grateful for the life I have here with Lilo and our friends.
        </p>
        <p>

        So, there you have it - a glimpse into the hobbies and passions of Stitch! Life is an adventure, and I'm
        ready to embrace every moment of it with a big smile on my face.
